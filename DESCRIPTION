Title: Pattern-Based Extraction to Link Records on Corporations From a Premade Lookup Table
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Steven", "Kang", email = "stevenhk@umich.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person("Second", "Author", role = "aut")
  )
Description: This package allows social scientists to easily link records on corporations where they 
    may go by different names and unique identifiers that do not exist. It will also allow the creation 
    of new datasets of corporation behavior by identifying corporation names in unstructured text and linking 
    these mentions to other datasets (for example, linking mentions of corporations in politicians’ speeches 
    with campaign donation data).
